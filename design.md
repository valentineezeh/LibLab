# Design Overview

The design focuses on creating a simple and intuitive user interface for our application. I have prioritized ease of use and clarity of information in order to create an enjoyable user experience.

## Design Elements

The design incorporates a clean and modern visual style, with a simple color scheme and consistent typography. I have also made use of tables to help users quickly understand the purpose which is mainly to display.

## User Flows

I have designed the user flows to be straightforward and easy to navigate. Users can quickly and easily access the main features of the application by clicking on the tabs on the navigation bar to get navigated to the respective page and view a table of Lord of the rings attributes.

## Future Plans

As I continue to develop this application, I plan to continue refining the design to further improve the user experience. I will be conducting user testing and gathering feedback to ensure that the design meets the needs and expectations of users.
